# hello-world

Newbie to this environment, but willing to adapt to changes.

I will be usig this to control a personal project, designing a system to automate & control the water supply infrastructure at my home.
I've chosen Raspberry Pi Pico W & Python as development tools, as they combine what I was looking for: WiFi integration, RTC clock, integrated file system, plenty GPIOs, timers & memory... also the possibility of using PIO to define FSMs intrigues me, though in the end, that learning curve is too steep-I'll stick to the basics.
